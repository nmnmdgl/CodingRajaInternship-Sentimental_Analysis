It is a simple Sentimental Annalysis model which determines the sentiments of the sentences such as fear, joy, anger etc. 
The model utilizes neattext NLP python library to pre-processing of the data.
The model also utilizes SVM algorithm to build this model.
In addition to all this I've utilized the streamlit framework to deploy a webapp of the model.
